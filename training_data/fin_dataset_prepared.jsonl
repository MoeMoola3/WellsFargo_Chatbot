Their customer service online chat disconnected twice as the Wells Fargo website auto logs you out after a certain time.

{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I have been a customer with WF for over 25 years. I was a Wachovia customer prior to the WF\/Wachovia merger. The stellar face to face customer service of Wachovia is non-existent with the current WellsFargo structure. Despite shuttered branches, fees continue to increase. After careful consideration, I am reluctantly closing all accounts with WF. I highly encourage potential customers to approach competitor financial institutions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Most horrible experience ever trying to open an account online with Wells Fargo. I tried opening an account, and entered all the information I was asked for, then the system responded by saying that my account was not opened. Called customer service and was transferred a million times before I was told that since I was unsuccessful in opening the account online, I would need to go into the branch! Are you serious this day and age someone needs to go into the branch to open an account when this is a simple operation with so many other banks to open an account online for that matter if you have an issue you are able to resolve it online rather than have to take time off and go into a branch and spend 2 hours there which I don't have...totally ridiculous!

But as of lately I have an issue with trying to scroll down online and see my transactions because you only see half the page and you can not even halfway see that when you scroll down. Other than that there's never really been an issue as long as I've been with Wells Fargo. So could we please get somebody from Wells Fargo to fix this issue because we'd like to have a full page of our transactions to be able to see everything, and it probably would be very bad with people that can barely see anyway! I'm sure that that would help them out a lot because I know that I have eye problems for my diabetes, so I understand the problem not being able to see but if someone could just fix the issues and everything would be perfect. Thank you Wells Fargo.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" This bank could be a great bank if they didn't steal from you. My account was below $500 for not even a week ($480) and they charged my account $10. When I called to refund that because of how ridiculous that was, they told me no because they have refunded $155 into my account in the last 12 months. Uh WHAT!? Those refunded charges wasn't even my fault but a company that took out a double payment! This bank is garbage.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I wouldn't advise anyone to use Wells Fargo bank. Been a customer for over 40 years, but will be changing soon. First, they questioned my husband's signature on a check, then they put a hold on it for 7 business days. No justifiable reason for any of it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I would not recommend Wells Fargo for any of your needs, they can't handle the information and you can't actually talk to a person in the department you need, I was talking to general customer service representative and supposedly they were back and forth with someone that I should have been talking to. And now I got the wrong information from this person and I have to pretty much start all over again, and wait for them, which will cost me more money in the long run. I want to say zero stars but this will not let me have a zero star review so I am putting one not in my favor.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Wells Fargo used to be a great bank. Now I would not give them a referral if they paid me for it.

{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" So, I needed to change my last name on all four of my Wells Fargo accounts because I got married. Was off work so I decided to stop in. Was told I needed an appointment or I could wait to see if they could fit me in. I was told they only had 2 ppl available to do this. I sat and waited. And waited. And waited. And watched 5 office people stand around and talk, joke, and drink coffee while one lady was working on appointments. This bank is run very inefficiently. If I did this at my job I would be fired! This is a 10 minute job that I now have to wait 8 days to do because I've been waiting almost 3 hours! Message me if you want to see the video I posted on social media it was too long to post. The workers here are so incompetent. It's terrible. I posted a pic of ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMERS IN HERE! Why am I still waiting? This bank is on Bloomingdale in Riverview, FL. Avoid this nightmare in customer service!\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I am a long-time customer of Wells Fargo (thru Wachovia | First Union | Wells Fargo mergers, etc.). I have existing accounts, including a CD, which I monitor online. I have applied online for additional CD's over the past seven days and have discovered that I cannot get status online or thru customer service on any of my applications. When i try to get application status online, i get a message that either info i submitted doesn't match their records or status isn't available online. I've spent hours on the phone with various CSR's@ Wells Fargo who all speak the same platitudes (wait five business days, reapply, etc.) but not one of them can access my applications using the Application Reference Numbers included with the only emails I received that acknowledge I've applied. I'm trying to purchase a Wells Fargo product! I chose this review site because when I tried to access the Give us Feedback link on the Wells Fargo online site, the link doesn't work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Have a credit card with Dillards run by Wells Fargo. Paid my account in full end of August. Money went thru my account and proof was sent to them beginning September. To date, I keep getting statements, same amount plus plus.

{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" After I had an account for 25+ years (They gobbled up my previous bank.), they refused to issue a new card to me unless I physically go to a branch. Problem is that I'm disabled and can't get to the US as I live in Mexico. They also refused to close my account after I managed to remove all of my funds. I would need to physically go to a branch to close the account! So, they can now collect monthly fees for not having funds in the account I can't close by phone or online. I'm pretty sure it's against state and federal law to discriminate against disabled persons. Do not bank with Wells, and if they take over your bank, get out fast! Don't wait like I did! Too bad there's no zero stars.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Very shady practices. I would definitely recommend not doing business with them. I needed a new oven. The agreement is, 0% interest if paid off within a year. 4 months later I needed a new refrigerator. I was making over the minimum payment (sometimes double) every month. Turns out they were splitting the payments between the two purchases and tried to charge me the back interest. Luckily I was able to pay it all off before the deadline. I asked them why they didn't put the payments toward the first purchase other than trying to screw people. They just said that's how Wells Fargo does it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I have been with Wellsfargo for 25 years or so and have never had a problem unresolved. They have expanded with multiple free services including Zelle, bill pay and free credit reports. Great bank.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" April 2021, I was scammed by who I thought was my utility company. I was asked to submit a $498 payment, via ZELLE, to ensure my late payment was not submitted to collections. Within a minute of pressing send I realized I was being duped. I immediately hung up and called Wells Fargo to request the payment be canceled or refunded. At the time, WF was unable to assist me with more than just taking down the information I had available of the scammers. Everyone I spoke with was polite and helpful but a refund was not possible. Fast forward 2 years. Today I received a letter stating they reevaluated my Zelle complaint and determined a refund was warranted. Not only was the full amount refunded, but they included interest! I was blown away that WF prompted this review and refund on their own accord. This is called business integrity. This is, in part, why I continue to bank with WF.\n"}

{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Wells Fargo Bank loves to take your money so stop using the your better off using a debit card that you buy from Walmart. Wells Fargo will open an accout that's called an opportunity account but they will not really explain how it works. On this accout they will tell you that it's like a regular account but they don't tell you it has lots of fee and restrictions. 1. You can not deposit a check from phone 2. If you deposit a check from other banks they will hold it for a week and if you have pending transactions even if you deposited that check 2 days ago they will allow the transactions to be paid but then they will charge you a $35.00 Nonsufficient funds even though you had a deposit pending for two days. They will put a $500 limit per day on your card even if you have enough money in your account they will deny any transactions or purchases of that day. If you met your limit for the day and you have a transaction pending they will deny it and charge another $35 even though you have money in your account to cover that transaction for the day. When you go to the branch to any of the branches to get this resolved they won't talk to you the route to you and they dismiss you. The only way the cartoon make a big issue for all the other customers and they will try to help you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I was recently traveling and was unable to complete a transaction. So I stopped into a local branch and a very nice young lady greeted me at the door with a smile and then assisted me. I have fraud protection on my account and I had been making a bunch of random purchases along with coffee, food and gas in various points down the Northrrn, Central and Southern California coast. So when I verified it was me and those were my transactions they unlocked my account and I was on my way. Some people would think that this is a huge unconvince and waste of time, but I am always greeted by a warm smile and had my banking needs met with WFB. I have been a customer since 1990.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" For over 2 months, i've been getting the same reply from WF dispute dept...we're working on it. They said that Delta had not responded but that WF was making headway and Delta had 40 days to respond...well it's been over 40 days and today...same response except 30 days. It's been a worthless effort to expect WF to follow thru and get this settled. I'm very disappointed in WF. I called Delta and had a super person...resolved in 20 min.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" I am a long-time customer of Wells Fargo (thru Wachovia | First Union | Wells Fargo mergers, etc.). I have existing accounts, including a CD, which I monitor online. I have applied online for additional CD's over the past seven days and have discovered that I cannot get status online or thru customer service on any of my applications. When i try to get application status online, i get a message that either info i submitted doesn't match their records or status isn't available online. I've spent hours on the phone with various CSR's@ Wells Fargo who all speak the same platitudes (wait five business days, reapply, etc.) but not one of them can | will access my applications using the Application Reference Numbers included with the only emails I received that acknowledge I've applied. I'm trying to purchase a Wells Fargo product! I chose this review site because when I tried to access the Give us Feedback link on the Wells Fargo online site, the link doesn't work.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" The Black mngr there was self-hating apparently, but very anti-Black after he had instructed me to travel to his bank there in Lake Oswego on May 9 to cash\/refund a Western Union m. O. drawn on Wells Fargo Bank. I guess he thought I was white during our phone conversation, but when I showed up, he made me wait for a long while as he paced around like a chicken with no head, grabbing and hugging white female customers as they entered the branch; they were uncomfortable and in shock by his random behavior. I realized maybe he is going to refuse me service promised over the phone and he did just that while treating indifferently as I tried to speak with him to get the m. O. cashed. He backtracked on his original promise and nastiky gestured at me physically and verbally. He refused to allow me to file a formal complaint also by discouraging me, telling me I'd have to wait a long while as they needed to help the other customers who were white and few. Finally I just left with my fiance who has had a Wells Fargo account for more than 25 years. Damien or Darren, one of the two names, behaved like a house negro treating me as a slave or unequal citizen without regard or my rights. He had to prove loudly and unprofessional overtly that although he's Black, me as a Black woman was garbage on his list. His co-workers looked on, one in disbelief, a female white, but all others never spoke up as it was normal. It was not. I felt humiliated, insignificant, embarrassed, discriminated against, and by someone who was of my same race. He should be fired. You may contact me for follow-up. Wish I could give a no-star rating.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Wells Fargo is the worst bank in America. I can't wait till my lawyers get finished with them. Watch y'all account their system is so easy to hack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Tell us about your experience with Wells Fargo? ->","completion":" Do because I had several transfers from my investment account into my checking account they basically said that was fraud had the nerve to put my account on hold and close my account. When I tried calling them they basically give me all these excuses and that's one thing about them they want to control your money they're very rude very unprofessional. If you're looking for a bank do not go to this bank at all they're not dependable they are the worst bank to dealt with and I would never recommend no one to Wells Fargo.\n"}
